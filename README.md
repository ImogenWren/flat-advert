## About Me
I am a working professional, and I am looking for a flatmate who has a similar lifestyle.
I enjoy socialising and will often have people over at weekends, but I also enjoy my own time, and I am respectful of those that also need their own time.
In my spare time I work on creative projects, I am a musician, I would love it if you were too!
I can be a loud person so may not be a suitable housemate for someone with sound sensitivity.

Rent is £500 pcm at the moment with rent due on the 17th of the month. Bills are not included, and at the moment are roughly £55 for each tenant for gas & electricity, and £76 each for council tax.
This flat is an aggressively LGBTQIA+ Positive space!
